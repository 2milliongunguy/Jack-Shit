# Jack Shit

welcome to Jack Shit.

everything here is designed to piss you off, including the error with a hardcoded line and column that doesn't even make sense.

this is my first time doing something like this, so enjoy.

please make this extremely awful to use, or even read.  
minimum standard of obfuscation: no "first-glance" understanding.

feel free to:

- use AI to obfuscate
- add useless stuff
- introduce chaos, as long as existing commands keep their behavior

pull requests that meet this standard are welcome, especially the ones that make you want to quit coding.

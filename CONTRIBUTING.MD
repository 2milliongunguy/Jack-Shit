- dont make code readable
- anything that makes it harder to read and understand is a feature
- dont change what existing commands do (their purpose must stay the same)
- go ahead and use AI
- bonus points for:
  - useless layers of indirection
  - misleading names
  - dead code that looks important
- all updates must be able to run the feature you added and also log "HELLO WORLD+"
